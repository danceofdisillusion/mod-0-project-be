# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal: 
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Michelle Randolph"
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
# YOUR CODE HERE
p house_elf
# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
# YOUR CODE HERE
hogwarts = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!"
p hogwarts
# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
# YOUR CODE HERE
students = students + 2
p students

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
# YOUR CODE HERE
students = students - 2
p students


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`. 
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Michelle"
is_hungry = true
number_of_pets = 0
p first_name
p is_hungry
p number_of_pets
# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above? 
# a name should be a string. Is hungry implies the question of are you hungary or not so should be boolean nubmer of pets should be a number

# Explain.


# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to
# different values (but same data type).
# Print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "V"
is_hungry = false
number_of_pets = 1
p first_name
p is_hungry
p number_of_pets

# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;

p healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks
p "Number of total snacks #{healthy_snacks+junk_food_snacks}"

# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out
# to the terminal as you would expect?
